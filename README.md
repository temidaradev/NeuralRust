# NeuralRust

## Overview
A neural network implementation written in Rust, designed for learning and experimentation with machine learning concepts.

## Requirements
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest stable version recommended)  

## Installation
Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/temidaradev/NeuralRust.git
cd NeuralRust
```

Build the project:

```sh
cargo build
```

Run the project and start the training:

```sh
cargo run
```

## Future of this project
Im thinking of: 

* Making this more "modular" like running different examples in different place
* Visualizing
* More flexible and usable

## Activation Functions:

* Identity
* ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
* Sigmoid
* Tanh

## What happpens when you run:
