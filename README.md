# NeuralRust

## Overview

A neural network implementation written in Rust, designed for learning and experimentation with machine learning concepts.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest stable version recommended)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/temidaradev/NeuralRust.git
cd NeuralRust
```

Or install from release:

There is only aarch64 mac and x86_64 windows executables!
[v0.1](https://github.com/temidaradev/NeuralRust/releases/tag/v0.1)

Build the project:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Run the project and start the training:

```sh
cargo run
```

Or the run current example which is same with in main with:

```sh
cargo run --example xor
```

## Future of this project

Im thinking of:

- Making this more "modular" like running different examples in different place
- Visualizing
- More flexible and usable

## Activation Functions:

- Identity
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Sigmoid
- Tanh
